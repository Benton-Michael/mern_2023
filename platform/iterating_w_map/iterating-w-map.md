# Iterating with map

The .map() method is a built-in JavaScript method that is available on arrays. It is not specific to React. The .map() method is used to iterate over an array and perform some operation on each element, returning a new array with the results.

In the context of React, the .map() method is commonly used to render lists of elements dynamically. It is often used in combination with JSX to render an array of components or elements based on the data.

So, while .map() is a JavaScript method, it is frequently used in React components to handle rendering and iterating over lists of elements.
