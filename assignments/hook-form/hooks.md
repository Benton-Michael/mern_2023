# Hooks and React

From React doc's: https://react.dev/

https://react.dev/reference/react

"Hooks solve a wide variety of seemingly unconnected 
problems in React that we’ve encountered over five years 
of writing and maintaining tens of thousands of components...

To solve these problems, Hooks let you use more of React’s 
features without classes. Conceptually, React components 
have always been closer to functions. Hooks embrace functions, 
but without sacrificing the practical spirit of React. 
Hooks provide access to imperative escape hatches 
and don’t require you to learn complex functional or 
reactive programming techniques.

A hook, generally speaking, is just a function (either a built-in or custom)
that allows the dev/ you to "hook" in or use a certain piece of
React functionality inside of your functional components.


# UPDATES and Changes

- the input elements had an incorrect attribute named text, 
which is not a valid attribute for input element in HTML. 
It has been changed to type instead.
