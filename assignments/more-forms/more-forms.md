# Add error messages to the Hook Forms assignment

1. If the firstName or lastName is less than 2 char
output an error message stating that the field must
be at least two char.

2. Email must be at least 5 characters (add error msg)
3. Passwords match and must be at least 8 char

- these messages should appear right when you render the page
and they will disappear in real-time.
Hint: Use state and conditional rendering
